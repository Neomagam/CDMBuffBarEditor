# CDMBuffBarEditor
WoW Addon to customize the Cooldown Manager Buff Bar. Created in patch 11.1.5

All customizations are made using the new Cooldown Manager API calls. As such, this level of "aura" customization should be possible even if buff tracking APIs are removed in the future. 
I plan to continue to develop this project and add more functionality as I can think of it. Please provide feedback or feature requests either on GitHub or by messaging me on Discord @Neomagam

## How to Use
1. Enable the Cooldown Manager:
- Open the main menu
- Select "Options"
- Under the "Gameplay" banner on the left-hand side, select "Advanced Options"
- Check the box next to "Enable Cooldown Manager"
 
2. Setup your Buff Bars
- Open the main menu
- Select "Edit Mode"
- Check the box next to "Cooldown Manager"
- Find the widget named "Tracked Bars"
 
3. Customize your abilites
- Open the main menu
- Select "Options"
- In the top left of that screen, select the "AddOns" tab
- Select "CDM Buff Bar Editor" on the list of pages on the left sidebar
- Check boxes next to abilities you want to appear in the Buff Bar
- Uncheck boxes next to abilities you want to hide
 
## Warnings
Some spells available in the menu are not trackable as Buff Bars currently. Given the way they are annotated in the API, I suspect they will be trackable in the future.
